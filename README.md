Lexicographic Permutation Generator
===================================

Simple Java library implememntation of the algorithm based on the research by Jeffery A. Johnson's, Brigham Young University-Hawaii Campus, paper 'SEPA: A Simple, Efficient Permutation Algorithm'.

http://www.oocities.org/permute_it/soda_submit.html

The library is unique in that it allows for the determining of the lexicographic (ordered) permutations of a string without the need of structures like stacks or recursion. Allowing for its use in limited resource environments, i.e. mobile devices.

Additionally ordered can be determined in both incremental and decremental (reverse).

Example:

Incremental: abc,acb,bac,bca,cab,cba

Decremental: cba,cab,bca,bac,acb,abc
